# Omnidirectional Stereo Vision for Depth Mapping

Code adapted from Toby Breckon's stereo sgmb program for depth mapping with omnidirectional cameras.

Also making use of some code developed by Sara Ismail for optimising the camera stream.

## New stuff

Work through the code to capture image pairs of chessboards to make calibration repeatable
